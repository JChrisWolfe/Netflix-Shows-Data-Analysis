# Netflix-Shows-Data-Analysis

## Project Description
This is a project on exploring data on Shows and Movies from Netflix using Python. This data is available to download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows). Data Cleaning will be that next step for this project at some time in the future. `Netflix Data Analytics.ipynb` asked some simple questions about the Shows and Movies on Netflix in Markdown format. This Python Notework show the basics of Data Analysis using Python's Pandas Module including the any graphs displayed on the Notebook.

## Software Requirements and Modules
For this project Jupyter was used via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). This would insure that you'd have all the necessary software and even modules are installed to use the project files. 

Add the following modules to your Python Code:
<ul>
  <li><code>import pandas as pd</code></li>
  <li><code>import numpy as np</code></li>
</ul>

## Run the Notebook using Jupyter
All that is required once you've installed the necessary software and modules is to only run this Jupyter Python Notebook is to just startup Jupyter alone or using the Anaconda Software. This project was created on a Windows 10 Operating System using Anaconda.

## Where to Start
`Netflix Data Analytics.ipynb` is the main file to start with.
